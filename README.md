## Data

- `therm_data/sensors` : raw data uploads from iButton sensors
    - within each file, serial numbers are in cell C1 and data begin on row 22 with timestamps (UTC) and temperature (C)
- `therm_data/ibkey.xlsx` : key to connect serial numbers for iButton sensors to experimental treatment and replication 
- `immune_data/observations.xlsx` : log of all observations over the course of the immune challenge assay
